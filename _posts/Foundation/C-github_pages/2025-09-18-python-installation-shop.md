Your customer wants a pet python snake! Here at the Pet Shop, you can pick it up for them! Here's how:

First, in your Kasm workspace, open a new terminal window. Then, run these commands:
```bash 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip
python3 --version
pip3 --version
# install packages later:
# pip3 install <package>
```
Great! Now you have picked up the python for your customer! Now, you'll need to check what type of python it is. In your terminal:
```
python --version
pip --version

```
You should have the latest python species. As of 2025, it is 

```
Python 3.13.7
pip 25.2 from /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pip (python 3.13
```

Congrats! You picked up your customer's python. Head onto the next button now! 🐍🐾

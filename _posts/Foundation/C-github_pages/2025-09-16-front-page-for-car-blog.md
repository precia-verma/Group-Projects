## You've Been Hired! 🚘📃

---

Welcome to the new CSSE pickup and delivery service! You've been hired to pick up different items for your customer and deliver it to them using your terminal. 

---

Your job is to make sure you first have a terminal on your machine. If you're driving a Kasm/Linux car, it should be in the top menu. If you're driving a MacOS car, it should already be installed. You can access it in your finder or apps. 

- **Remember:** If you're driving a MacOS car, the instructions for a Kasm/Linux car will not work for you, and is guranteed to cause errors, and vice versa. Make sure to follow the instructions for your specific machine. 

---

Now--your customer has created a list of items to pickup. You will obtain these items and then add them into your terminal:
1. 1 Homebrew 🍺
2. Shiny Ruby Gems 💎♦️
3. 1 Python Snake 🐍

Once you've added all of these into your terminal--it will immediately be delivered to your customer. Good luck!

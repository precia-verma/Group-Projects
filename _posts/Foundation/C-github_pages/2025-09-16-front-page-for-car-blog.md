## You've Been Hired!

---

Welcome to the new CSSE pickup and delivery service! You've been hired to pick up different items for your customer and deliver it to them using your terminal. 

---

Your job is to make sure you first have a terminal on your machine. If you're driving a Kasm/Linux car, it should be in the top menu. If you're driving a MacOS car, it should already be installed. You can access it in your finder or apps. 

- **Remember:** If you're driving a MacOS car, the instructions for a Kasm/Linux car will not work for you, and is guranteed to cause errors, and vice versa. Make sure to follow the instructions for your specific machine. 

---

Now--your customer has created a list of items to pickup. You will obtain these items and then add them into your terminal:
1. 1 Homebrew 🍺
2. Shiny Ruby Gems 💎♦️
3. 1 Python Snake 🐍

To do so, go to `https://brew.sh/` and follow the instructions.

On the website, it will tell you to run this code in your terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
You may need enter your password into terminal. Then, wait for your order to finish. Finally, make sure to run this: (make sure to put the word `sudo` before pasting this code)
```bash
echo >> /Users/anshrathod/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' »> /Users/anshrathod/ •zprof
ile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
Your order should be complete now! But first--take a sip to make sure it's ready for your customer! Run `brew --version` to make sure your Homebrew is correctly installed. If the output is `Homebrew (version number)` then your brew is perfect and ready for your customer.

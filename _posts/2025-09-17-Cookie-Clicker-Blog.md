## ü•õ Hack 2: Your Own Feature ‚Äì **Milk Upgrade**

### Purpose  
The **Milk Upgrade** is a purchasable item in the Cookie Clicker game shop (Cost: **1000 cookies**).  
Buying Milk gives a sweet boost: it **doubles cookies per click** and makes the grind way more strategic.

## ü•õ How the Milk Upgrade Works (Code Explained)

```javascript
// --- Milk Upgrade Feature ---
const milkUpgrade = {
  name: "Milk",
  emoji: "ü•õ",
  price: 1000,
  itemEffected: "click",
  multiplier: 2,
};

// Add Milk to upgrades list
shop.upgrades.push(milkUpgrade);

// Restore Milk upgrade from localStorage
let hasMilk = localStorage.getItem("hasMilk") === "true";

// Listen for Milk button click
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const milkBtn = document.getElementById("milkBtn");
  if (milkBtn) {
    if (hasMilk) milkBtn.disabled = true;
    milkBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
      if (hasMilk) {
        alert("You already own Milk!");
        return;
      }
      if (cookie.cookies >= milkUpgrade.price) {
        cookie.addCookies(-milkUpgrade.price);
        cookie.cookieMulti *= milkUpgrade.multiplier;
        hasMilk = true;
        localStorage.setItem("hasMilk", "true");
        milkBtn.disabled = true;
        alert("Milk purchased! Your cookies per click are doubled.");
      } else {
        alert("Not enough cookies!");
      }
    });
  }
});
```

### What does this code mean and what does it do?
- This code adds a new upgrade called "Milk" to the Cookie Clicker shop. The Milk upgrade costs 1000 cookies and, when purchased, doubles the number of cookies you get per click.
- The `milkUpgrade` object defines the upgrade's name, emoji, price, what it affects (clicks), and its multiplier (2x).
- The upgrade is added to the shop's list of upgrades so it appears in the game.
- The code checks if the player already owns Milk by looking in `localStorage` (so the upgrade is remembered even if you reload the page).
- When the Milk button is clicked:
  - If you already own Milk, it shows an alert and does nothing.
  - If you have enough cookies, it subtracts the price, doubles your cookies per click, marks Milk as owned, saves this to `localStorage`, disables the button, and shows a success alert.
  - If you don't have enough cookies, it shows an alert saying so.

This feature makes the game more strategic and rewarding, giving players a big boost when they buy Milk!

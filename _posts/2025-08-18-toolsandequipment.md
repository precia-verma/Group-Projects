# 🚀 Tools and Equipment

Suit up, space cadet! These pages from **Open Coding Society** are your essential planets in the dev galaxy.  
Click the links, explore the knowledge, and level-up your mission control skills.

<section>

## 🪐 [Main Command Center](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/tools/)

**Mission Objective:** Big-picture overview of all the dev gear.  
* Why version control and good tooling save you from black-hole chaos.  
* How different tools—editors, GitHub, terminals—work together in a single orbit.  
* Best practices for collaborating with other interstellar coders.

</section>

<section>

## 🌌 [Accounts](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/tools/accounts)

**Mission Objective:** Secure your digital identity before launch.  
* Learn what counts as **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** and how to guard it.  
* Step-by-step creation of key accounts like GitHub, Slack/Discord, and any project-hosting platforms.  
* Tips on strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and keeping public vs. private data separated.  
* Why a clean public profile matters for future collabs and job hunting across galaxies.

</section>

<section>

## 🚀 [GitHub](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/tools/github)

**Mission Objective:** Master the starship of version control.  
* How repositories, commits, and branches track every line of code.  
* Forking & Pull Requests: collaborate across galaxies without collision.  
* Understanding issues, project boards, and roles (owner vs. contributor).  
* Etiquette for commit messages and reviewing PRs so teammates don’t get lost in a wormhole.

</section>

<section>

## 🌠 [GitHub Pages](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/tools/github_pages)

**Mission Objective:** Deploy your cosmic creations to the universe.  
* Free static-site hosting directly from your GitHub repo—perfect for portfolios and documentation.  
* Setting up a site: enabling Pages, selecting a theme, configuring a custom domain.  
* Using GitHub Actions to automate builds and updates, so your site stays as fresh as a nebula.  
* Tips for markdown-driven sites and Jekyll basics.

</section>

<section>

## 🛰️ [Operating Systems](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/tools/os)

**Mission Objective:** Configure your home planet for coding.  
* Windows + WSL, macOS, and Linux setup guides with package managers (Homebrew, apt, etc.).  
* Installing shell tools like Git, Python, and compilers.  
* Environment variables and PATH—so your commands work anywhere in the galaxy.  
* Cross-platform quirks to watch out for when collaborating with devs on other OS planets.

</section>

<section>

## 🛸 [VSCode](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/tools/vscode)

**Mission Objective:** Build the ultimate coding cockpit.  
* Installing VSCode and must-have extensions for linting, debugging, and Git integration.  
* Setting up a project folder, using integrated terminal, and customizing the editor theme (dark mode = true space vibes).  
* Using Live Server or dev containers to test code locally before you launch.  
* Keyboard shortcuts and productivity hacks to move at lightspeed.

</section>

<section>

## 💫 [Troubleshooting](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/tools/trouble)

**Mission Objective:** Escape any black hole of bugs.  
* Common issues when pushing to GitHub Pages, fixing merge conflicts, and broken builds.  
* Debugging tips: reading stack traces, checking logs, and using the terminal like a pro.  
* How to ask for help effectively (good error reports = faster rescue missions).  
* Quick commands to reset, revert, or recover when something explodes mid-flight.

### 🌟 Final Star Tips

* **Test Locally First:** Don’t launch a broken starship—run and debug before committing.  
* **Commit Messages = Star Maps:** Descriptive logs help future explorers (including future-you).  
* **Stay Secure:** Guard your credentials like they’re oxygen tanks.  
* **Document Everything:** Good READMEs and comments are like leaving space beacons for your crew.

> *“Shoot for the stars, but push to GitHub first.”* 🌌
